# Energy-Efficient-Automation-System
This project developed an energy-efficient automation system for smart buildings. Using IoT sensors for temperature, humidity, and light monitoring, we applied ML models to optimize HVAC performance. Gradient Boosting, identified as the best model, enhanced energy efficiency and comfort. I'm grateful for my teammates' dedication and expertise.
